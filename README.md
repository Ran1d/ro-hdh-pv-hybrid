**Abstract**  
This feasibility study integrates Concentrated Photovoltaic/Thermal (CPV/T) systems with Humidification-Dehumidification (HDH) and Reverse Osmosis (RO) desalination to achieve minimum liquid discharge. Simulations in MATLAB and EES, plus experimental testing, show the system's viability for sustainable freshwater production.

**Experimental Setup**  
- CPV/T: Solar radiation 300–1000 W/m², mass flow 0.01–0.049 kg/s  
- RO: Feed flow 2.5–10 m³/s, pressure 2000–8000 kPa  
- HDH: Analyzed distilled water flow vs relative humidity and feed temperature  

**Key Results**  
- Optimal RO feed flow = 2.5 m³/s → 40 % recovery rate, pumping power 0.6 kW  
- Optimal CPV/T flow = 0.01 kg/s → Outlet temperature 69 °C, overall efficiency 57.89 %  
- HDH: Distilled water increases linearly with RH and exponentially with feed temperature  

**Tools & Methods**  
- Simulations: MATLAB (thermal modeling) + EES (energy balance)  
- Experimental: Lab setup with varying solar radiation and flows  
- Goal: Zero/minimum liquid discharge for sustainable desalination
